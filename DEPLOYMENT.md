# Vercel Deployment Guide for Cipher Collaborate AI

This comprehensive guide will walk you through deploying the Cipher Collaborate AI project to Vercel step by step.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment process, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ GitHub account with access to the repository
- ‚úÖ Vercel account (free tier available at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- ‚úÖ Node.js 18+ installed locally (for testing)
- ‚úÖ Modern web browser

## üîß Step 1: Environment Variables Setup

### Create Environment Variables File

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Blockchain Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID

# Wallet Connect Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-wallet-connect-project-id

# Infura Configuration (Optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=your-infura-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://1rpc.io/sepolia
```

### Important Notes:
- **Never commit** `.env.local` to version control
- All environment variables must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access
- Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Production Optimizations

### 5.1 Build Configuration

Create `vercel.json` in project root for advanced configuration:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID": "11155111",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL": "https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID": "your-wallet-connect-project-id",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY": "your-infura-api-key"
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        }
      ]
    }

4. **Monitor Security** with Vercel's security features

## üîç Step 6: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 6.1 Build Failures
**Problem**: Build process fails during deployment

**Solutions**:
- Check Node.js version compatibility (requires 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are properly installed
- Review TypeScript errors in build logs
- Ensure environment variables are correctly set

#### 6.2 Environment Variables Not Working
**Problem**: Environment variables not accessible in the application

**Solutions**:
- Ensure variables start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Redeploy after adding new variables
- Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify variables are set in Vercel dashboard

#### 6.3 Wallet Connection Issues
**Problem**: Wallet connection not working in production

**Solutions**:
- Verify WalletConnect Project ID is correct
- Check RPC URL accessibility
- Ensure correct chain ID is configured
- Test with different wallet providers

#### 6.4 Contract Interaction Failures
**Problem**: Smart contract interactions not working

**Solutions**:
- Verify contract address is correct and deployed
- Check network configuration matches contract deployment
- Ensure user has sufficient funds for transactions
- Verify contract ABI is up to date

### Debug Steps

#### 6.1 Check Build Logs
```bash
vercel logs [deployment-url]
```

#### 6.2 Local Testing
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

#### 6.3 Environment Variable Testing
- Use browser dev tools to check if variables are loaded
- Verify in Network tab that requests go to correct endpoints
- Check console for any configuration errors
